You've been more than just a teacher—you're the Sherlock to our mysteries, the compass guiding us through life's twists and turns. Your wit sharpens our minds with the pj's you never stop cracking, and your sass adds just the right amount of spice to our day. You're a true mentor and friend, always turning "lesson" into "fun," one craziness at a time. Here's to the guide who always finds the write path for us, and to the cutie who makes learning a pun-derful adventure! Love you !</h4>
